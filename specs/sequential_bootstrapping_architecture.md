# Sequential Bootstrapping Architecture - CLARIFICATION

**Created**: 2024-12-28 16:50
**Purpose**: Explain our multi-stage approach and why it's NOT full CAI until Stage 6

## Overall Architecture: Building Capabilities Step by Step

### The Core Insight
We start with a base model that only knows text completion and gradually build up capabilities through 6 stages. Each stage uses the previous stage's model to generate training data for the next capability.

## Stage Progression and Capabilities

### Stage 1: Instruction Recognition (CURRENT)
- **Input**: Base model (text completion only)
- **Capability Trained**: Recognize and follow instruction patterns
- **Method**: Completion-style prompting → critique → improve → DPO
- **Constitutional Elements**: Basic principles for critiques only
- **Output**: Model that follows explicit instructions
- **Success Metric**: 95% instruction-following rate

### Stage 2: Implicit Understanding
- **Input**: Stage 1 model (can follow instructions)
- **Capability Trained**: Handle implicit/indirect instructions
- **Method**: Stage 1 model generates training data
- **Output**: Model that understands context and implications

### Stage 3: Generation
- **Input**: Stage 2 model
- **Capability Trained**: Generate diverse, high-quality content
- **Method**: Stage 2 model creates generation examples
- **Output**: Model that generates better content

### Stage 4: Evaluation
- **Input**: Stage 3 model
- **Capability Trained**: Evaluate text quality and correctness
- **Method**: Stage 3 model generates evaluation examples
- **Output**: Model that can judge text

### Stage 5: Revision
- **Input**: Stage 4 model
- **Capability Trained**: Improve and revise text
- **Method**: Stage 4 model creates revision examples
- **Output**: Model that can improve content

### Stage 6: Constitutional Integration (FULL CAI)
- **Input**: Stage 5 model (has all capabilities)
- **Capability Trained**: Full constitutional alignment
- **Method**: Complete CAI with all principles
- **Constitutional Elements**: FULL implementation
- **Output**: Constitutionally aligned model

## Why This Is NOT Constitutional AI Until Stage 6

### What We're Doing in Stages 1-5
- Using basic principles to guide data generation
- Building prerequisite capabilities
- Sequential bootstrapping of skills
- NOT claiming constitutional alignment

### What Happens in Stage 6
- Full constitutional principles
- Comprehensive principle tracking
- Multi-principle evaluation
- True constitutional alignment
- This is where "CAI" actually happens

## Common Misconceptions

### Misconception 1: "Every stage should track constitutional principles"
**Reality**: 
- Stages 1-5 are building blocks
- Constitutional tracking is overhead until Stage 6
- We use principles as tools, not as alignment targets yet

### Misconception 2: "This should be CAI from the start"
**Reality**:
- CAI requires capabilities the base model doesn't have
- We must build instruction-following first
- Then evaluation, then revision, THEN constitutional alignment

### Misconception 3: "Critiques should reference specific principles"
**Reality**:
- In Stage 1, critiques just help improve instruction-following
- Principle tagging becomes relevant in Stage 6
- Early stages use principles as prompting tools only

## For Reviewers: What to Evaluate at Each Stage

### Stage 1 (Instruction Following)
✅ Does the model learn to follow instructions?
✅ Is the improvement measurable?
❌ Don't expect constitutional alignment
❌ Don't expect principle tracking

### Stages 2-5 (Capability Building)
✅ Does each capability build on the previous?
✅ Is the bootstrapping working?
❌ Don't expect full CAI implementation
❌ Don't expect comprehensive principle coverage

### Stage 6 (Constitutional Integration)
✅ NOW expect full constitutional implementation
✅ NOW expect principle tracking
✅ NOW expect alignment metrics
✅ NOW evaluate as true CAI

## Why Sequential Bootstrapping?

### The Problem with Doing Everything at Once
- Base model can't follow instructions
- Can't evaluate without following instructions
- Can't revise without evaluation
- Can't align without all capabilities

### Our Solution
1. Teach each capability separately
2. Use each capability to bootstrap the next
3. Only integrate constitutionally when ready
4. Maximize automation at each step

## Key Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Simple Stages First
- Start with the easiest capability (instruction-following)
- Build complexity gradually
- Each stage has a single, clear goal

### Decision 2: Principles as Tools, Not Targets (Stages 1-5)
- Use principles to guide data generation
- Don't track principle adherence yet
- Focus on capability building

### Decision 3: Full CAI Only When Ready (Stage 6)
- Wait until all capabilities exist
- Then do comprehensive constitutional alignment
- This is where we make CAI claims

## Success Metrics by Stage

### NOT Constitutional Metrics (Stages 1-5):
- Instruction-following rate
- Task completion accuracy  
- Generation quality
- Evaluation accuracy
- Revision improvement

### Constitutional Metrics (Stage 6 ONLY):
- Principle adherence rate
- Constitutional violation detection
- Alignment with each principle
- Harmful output prevention
- Value alignment measurements

## Summary for Reviewers

Please evaluate each stage for what it is:
- **Stages 1-5**: Capability building through bootstrapping
- **Stage 6**: Constitutional AI implementation

Don't expect CAI features in early stages. We're building the foundation first, then adding constitutional alignment when the model has the necessary capabilities to understand and follow complex principles.

This is sequential bootstrapping BY DESIGN, not an incomplete CAI implementation.
