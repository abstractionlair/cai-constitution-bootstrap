# Stage 1: Explicit Instruction Following (Overview)

Goal
- Teach a base model to reliably follow explicit instructions via SFT, using data generated by the base model in completion mode and filtered by single-token A/B critics.

Approach (Summary)
- Generate instructions via completion-style few-shot prompts; parse and filter with an instruction critic.
- Generate responses with a canonical "Instruction: â€¦\nResponse:" prompt; clean via delimiter/heuristics; filter with a pair critic.
- Train SFT with QLoRA; evaluate deterministically with paired tests and proper statistics.

Gates & Criteria
- Data Gen Pilot QC thresholds must pass before scaling.
- SFT Pilot must yield statistically significant improvement (McNemar p<0.01 overall) with CIs/effect sizes reported.
