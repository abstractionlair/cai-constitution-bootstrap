# Code Review Checklist for Stage 1 Deployment

## Overview
Review of Stage 1 code before deployment to RunPod A100 SXM 80GB ($1.74/hr)

## ‚úÖ Good Things I See

### Structure
- Clear separation of concerns (baseline, generate, train, evaluate)
- Proper logging throughout
- Good error handling with try/except blocks
- Utils folder for shared functionality
- Pipeline orchestrator to run everything

### Technical Choices
- Using Unsloth for memory efficiency
- 4-bit quantization for training (appropriate)
- LoRA rank 64 (good for instruction following)
- Target modules include all attention and MLP layers
- Checkpoint saving for LoRA adapters only

### Safety
- Constitution loading implemented
- Low temperature (0.1) for baseline testing
- Proper GPU memory management
- Reproducible seed (3407)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Concerns to Check

### 1. Model Loading
```python
# In baseline_assessment.py
self.model_name = "Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B"
```
**Question**: Is this definitely the BASE model, not Instruct? 
**Check**: Verify on HuggingFace that this is the pretrained model

### 2. Memory Configuration
```python
# In train_stage1_dpo.py
load_in_4bit=True  # For memory efficiency
```
**Question**: With 80GB VRAM, should we use 8-bit for better quality?
**Consideration**: 4-bit is fine for training, but for generation between stages, consider 8-bit

### 3. Sequence Length
```python
max_seq_length=2048
```
**Question**: Is 2048 tokens enough for instruction+response?
**Check**: Most Stage 1 examples should be short, so this is probably fine

### 4. LoRA Configuration
```python
r=64,                    # Rank
lora_alpha=16,           # Alpha parameter
```
**Question**: Is alpha=16 with r=64 the right ratio? 
**Note**: Usually alpha = 2*r or alpha = r, so this seems low

### 5. Missing Components?
- Where's the critique and rewrite logic for generating preference pairs?
- Is there a function to merge LoRA for inference between stages?
- How do we convert to 8-bit/16-bit for generation quality?

## üîç Files to Review with Gemini/Codex

### For Gemini (Technical Review):
1. **Memory efficiency**: Is Unsloth + 4-bit optimal for 80GB?
2. **LoRA parameters**: Are r=64, alpha=16 appropriate?
3. **Target modules**: Are we targeting the right layers for Qwen?
4. **Batch size**: What batch size can we use with 80GB?
5. **Gradient accumulation**: Should we add this?

### For Codex (Methodology Review):
1. **Baseline metrics**: Are we measuring the right things?
2. **Data diversity**: How diverse are the generated instructions?
3. **Evaluation criteria**: Is 95% success rate realistic?
4. **Preference pair quality**: How do we ensure good chosen/rejected pairs?
5. **Constitutional alignment**: Where exactly does constitution come in for Stage 1?

## üìã Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Must Have:
- [ ] Verify BASE model (not Instruct)
- [ ] Test baseline assessment locally first
- [ ] Confirm critique/rewrite logic exists
- [ ] Check data generation creates proper preference pairs
- [ ] Verify checkpoint saving works

### Should Have:
- [ ] Add batch size configuration for 80GB
- [ ] Implement LoRA merging for inter-stage inference
- [ ] Add progress tracking/cost estimation
- [ ] Include early stopping if metrics plateau
- [ ] Add data validation before training

### Nice to Have:
- [ ] Wandb integration for monitoring
- [ ] Automatic cost tracking
- [ ] Resume from checkpoint capability
- [ ] Data quality histograms
- [ ] Model size validation

## üö® Critical Questions Before Running

1. **Where is the preference pair generation?**
   - Stage 1 needs chosen/rejected pairs for DPO
   - How are we creating the "rejected" examples?

2. **What's our data generation strategy?**
   - Are we generating synthetic instructions?
   - Using a fixed set?
   - How do we ensure diversity?

3. **How do we measure success?**
   - What exactly is "instruction following"?
   - How do we score it objectively?

4. **Cost management:**
   - Any automatic stopping conditions?
   - Checkpoint frequency?
   - What if it runs longer than expected?

## üí≠ Recommendation

The code structure looks good, but I'd want to see:
1. The utils folder contents (especially preference pair generation)
2. A small local test run first
3. Clear stopping conditions
4. The actual critique/rewrite logic for Stage 1

**Suggest asking Gemini**: 
- "Check the memory calculations for 32B model with LoRA on 80GB"
- "Validate the LoRA configuration for instruction tuning"

**Suggest asking Codex**:
- "Review the evaluation methodology for instruction following"
- "Check if the preference pair generation aligns with DPO best practices"

## üéØ Go/No-Go Decision

**WAIT** - Need to verify:
1. Preference pair generation logic
2. BASE model confirmation
3. Small local test first

Once these are confirmed, the structure looks solid for deployment!
