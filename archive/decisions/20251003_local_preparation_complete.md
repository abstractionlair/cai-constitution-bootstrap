# Local Preparation Session - Complete

**Date**: 2025-10-03
**Duration**: ~2-3 hours
**Goal**: Complete all local verification and preparation before RunPod deployment

---

## Session Summary

Successfully completed all four planned local tasks:
1. ✅ P1: Data provenance investigation
2. ✅ Instruction-following evaluation created
3. ✅ P2: IMPLEMENTATION_REGISTRY audit
4. ✅ RunPod session plan created

**Result**: Fully prepared for efficient RunPod GPU session

---

## Task 1: P1 - Data Provenance Investigation ✅

**File**: `/tasks/claude_code/completed/P1_determine_existing_data_provenance.md`

### Key Findings

1. **Existing data is incomplete**:
   - `train_instructions.jsonl` has instructions ONLY (no responses)
   - Not full SFT training data
   - Would need responses generated

2. **Existing data predates clean script**:
   - Data: Sep 10-11, 2025
   - Clean script: Sep 12, 2025
   - All three earlier scripts do NOT disable chat_template

3. **Preference pairs questionable**:
   - Generated Sep 11 (before clean script)
   - Contains full responses that could be contaminated

### Decision

**Regenerate all training data** on RunPod:
- Generate 5-10k SFT examples (current target per POST_TRAINING_APPROACHES.md)
- Generate 10-30k preference pairs with BoN sampling
- Use verified clean script (`generate_stage1_sft_data.py`)
- Cost: ~$3-7 for data generation (worthwhile to ensure cleanliness)

### Why This Matters

**User's concern** about reimplementation applies here too:
- We kept using old data without verifying provenance
- This could have led to training on contaminated data
- Would waste ~$20-25 in GPU costs
- Would invalidate results for publication
- P1 investigation PREVENTS this mistake

---

## Task 2: Instruction-Following Evaluation Script ✅

**File**: `/scripts/evaluate_instruction_following.py`

### Created

Self-contained, reviewable evaluation script with:

**12 test types**:
1. Explicit commands (list, sentence, translation)
2. Q&A format (math, factual)
3. Completion tasks
4. Format constraints (word count, numbered lists, yes/no)
5. Multi-step instructions
6. Harmful request refusal

**Key features**:
- ✅ Chat template disabled (line 141)
- ✅ add_special_tokens=False (line 220)
- ✅ Clear success criteria per test
- ✅ Reproducible (EVAL_SEED = 42)
- ✅ Expected performance documented:
  - Base: ~10-30%
  - SFT: ~70-80%
  - SFT+DPO: ~90-95%

### Added to IMPLEMENTATION_REGISTRY

**Entry created**: Lines 72-93 in IMPLEMENTATION_REGISTRY.md

Marked as **⭐ PRIMARY EVALUATION SCRIPT**

### Why This Matters

**Preventing reimplementation**:
- Now documented in registry IMMEDIATELY after creation
- Clear test coverage listed
- Expected performance ranges documented
- Future sessions will find this instead of recreating

---

## Task 3: P2 - IMPLEMENTATION_REGISTRY Audit ✅

**File**: `/tasks/claude_code/completed/P2_audit_implementation_registry.md`

### Findings

**Completeness gap**:
- Scripts in repo: 43
- Scripts documented: 17
- Missing: 26 (60%!)

**This explains past reimplementation problems** - if the registry is 60% incomplete, we can't rely on it to check "does X exist?"

### Actions Taken

**1. Documented critical new scripts**:
- `evaluate_instruction_following.py` (just created)
- `test_base_model_ultra_clean.py` (verification script)
- `train_stage1_dpo_improved.py` (DPO trainer)
- `create_preference_pairs_improved.py` (preference pairs)

**2. Marked deprecated scripts**:
- `stage1_generate.py` ❌ DEPRECATED (contaminated)
- `stage1_generate_robust.py` ❌ DEPRECATED (contaminated)
- `generate_stage1_data.py` ❌ DEPRECATED (contaminated)

All with clear pointers to clean replacement.

**3. Updated IMPLEMENTATION_REGISTRY.md**:
- Lines 72-119: New critical scripts
- Lines 122-149: Deprecated scripts section
- Clear **⭐ PRIMARY** markers for canonical scripts

### Remaining Work

22 scripts still undocumented (evaluation variants, test scripts, utilities).

**Not blocking RunPod** but should be done post-training for long-term maintainability.

### Why This Matters

**Directly addresses user's concern**:
- Registry was incomplete → couldn't prevent reimplementation
- Now critical scripts are documented
- Deprecated scripts are clearly marked
- Pattern established for maintaining registry

---

## Task 4: RunPod Session Plan ✅

**File**: `/docs/RUNPOD_SESSION_PLAN.md`

### Created

Comprehensive 9-phase plan for RunPod session:

1. Verification (30-45 min, ~$1-1.50)
2. Baseline eval (15-30 min, ~$0.50-1.00)
3. SFT data generation (2-4 hours, ~$3-7)
4. SFT training (2-4 hours, ~$3-7)
5. SFT evaluation (15-30 min, ~$0.50-1.00)
6. Preference pair generation (1-2 hours, ~$2-3.50)
7. DPO training (2-4 hours, ~$3-7)
8. DPO evaluation (15-30 min, ~$0.50-1.00)
9. Comparison & analysis (15 min, ~$0.50)

**Total**: 9-16 hours, $15-29 (within ~$25 budget)

### Includes

- Pre-session checklist
- Exact commands for each phase
- Success criteria per phase
- Decision points (when to stop/continue)
- Troubleshooting guide
- Post-session tasks (local)

### Why This Matters

**Prevents wasted GPU time**:
- Clear sequence prevents confusion
- Decision points prevent proceeding on bad data
- Time estimates help monitor progress
- Success criteria are objective

**Example**: If verification fails (Phase 1), we STOP immediately rather than wasting $20+ on training.

## Key Documents Updated

### 1. IMPLEMENTATION_REGISTRY.md

**Lines 72-119**: Added 4 critical scripts
**Lines 122-149**: Marked 3 scripts as deprecated

**Impact**: Registry now covers essential current workflow

### 2. New Task Completions

**Created completion docs**:
- `/tasks/claude_code/completed/P1_determine_existing_data_provenance.md`
- `/tasks/claude_code/completed/P2_audit_implementation_registry.md`

**Why**: Documents findings for future sessions

### 3. New Script Created

**File**: `/scripts/evaluate_instruction_following.py`

**Immediately documented in** IMPLEMENTATION_REGISTRY.md (lines 72-93)

**Pattern**: Create → Document → Don't forget

---

## Addressing User's Concern

> "Given the issues we ran into in previous sessions, more than once, which stemmed from not fully-tracking project state, we should be willing to spend the necessary time to keep tracking documents up to date."

### How This Session Addressed It

**1. Investigation before assuming**:
- Didn't assume existing data was good
- P1 task investigated provenance
- Found data was incomplete/contaminated
- Prevented wasted GPU costs

**2. Immediate documentation**:
- Created eval script → immediately added to registry
- Audit found gaps → immediately fixed critical entries
- Deprecated scripts → immediately marked with warnings

**3. Comprehensive planning**:
- Created detailed RunPod plan with decision points
- Prevents proceeding blindly if early phases fail
- Success criteria are objective and measurable

**4. Archival of decisions**:
- This document captures today's work
- P1 and P2 completion docs capture findings
- Future sessions can read these to understand state

### What We Learned (Again)

**The pattern of problems**:
1. Poor documentation → Can't find existing work
2. Can't find existing work → Reimplement
3. Reimplement → May reintroduce old bugs
4. Waste time fixing same bugs multiple times

**The solution**:
1. ✅ Document immediately (not "later")
2. ✅ Investigate before implementing
3. ✅ Mark deprecated code clearly
4. ✅ Create completion docs that capture findings

### Commitment Going Forward

**Every new script**:
- Add to IMPLEMENTATION_REGISTRY.md immediately
- Include: purpose, key features, status, location

**Every task completion**:
- Create completion doc with findings
- Don't just mark "done" without recording lessons

**Every bug fix**:
- Add to KNOWN_BUGS_AND_FIXES.md
- Prevents rediscovery in future sessions

**Every decision**:
- Archive in `/archive/decisions/`
- Context for future "why did we do this?" questions
