# DAG Restructuring Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-03
**Scope**: Complete documentation restructuring into DAG architecture

---

## Goals Achieved

1. ‚úÖ Clear DAG structure with minimal duplication
2. ‚úÖ README.md as goals + navigation hub (no implementation details)
3. ‚úÖ Agent configs minimal with "read README first" + both queue checks
4. ‚úÖ Single consolidated STANDARDS.md
5. ‚úÖ High-level ROADMAP.md with ‚úÖ/‚è≥/üìã status markers
6. ‚úÖ Unified review system (single queue, mandatory assignment)
7. ‚úÖ Universal assignment system (tasks + reviews)
8. ‚úÖ Filesystem as source of truth (no dashboards to maintain)
9. ‚úÖ All agents check both task and review queues

---

## New Files Created

### Core Navigation
1. **ROADMAP.md** - Milestone checklist with status markers
2. **docs/STANDARDS.md** - Consolidated standards (files, code, docs, reviews, assignments, git)
3. **reviews/README.md** - Unified review system documentation

### Restructured Files
1. **README.md** - Goals + navigation only (stripped implementation details)
2. **status/PROJECT_STATUS.md** - Minimal narrative (context, not checklists)
3. **CLAUDE.md** - Minimal + both queues
4. **codex.md** - Minimal + both queues
5. **GEMINI.md** - Minimal + both queues

---

## Directory Changes

### Review System Migration
**Before**:
```
/reviews/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gemini/{pending,done,responses}/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ codex/{pending,done,responses}/
```

**After**:
```
/reviews/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requests/          # Single queue
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ responses/         # All responses ({topic}_{reviewer}.md)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ archive/           # Old structure archived
```

**Migrated**: 12 review response files renamed with `_{reviewer}` suffix

### Task System Enhancement
- Added `**Assigned To**: claude_code` to all 14 pending tasks
- Enables flexible assignment in future
- All agents now check both queues

---

## Information Architecture (Final DAG)

```
Entry Points ‚Üí Navigation Hub ‚Üí Domain Docs

README.md (goals)
‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí ROADMAP.md (milestones ‚úÖ/‚è≥/üìã)

‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí Both queues (grep for assignments)
```

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Filesystem as Source of Truth
**Decision**: No dashboards (REVIEW_DASHBOARD, TASK_DASHBOARD)
**Rationale**: Prevents state duplication and sync issues
**Implementation**: Agents query filesystem directly with grep

### 2. Mandatory Assignment
**Decision**: Every task and review must specify assignment
**Rationale**: Eliminates ambiguity about completion and ownership
**Implementation**: `Assigned To` for tasks, `Assigned Reviewers` for reviews

### 3. Universal Queue Checking
**Decision**: All agents check both task and review queues
**Rationale**: Enables flexible assignment (anyone can be assigned anything)
**Implementation**: Grep commands in each agent config

### 4. Minimal Agent Configs
**Decision**: Agent files focus on role + queue finding, delegate to shared docs
**Rationale**: Reduces duplication, creates clear information hierarchy
**Implementation**: "Read README first" pattern

### 5. Goals vs. Status Separation
**Decision**: README = goals (timeless), PROJECT_STATUS = context (changes frequently)
**Rationale**: Goals don't change, status does - separate them
**Implementation**: README has no status, ROADMAP has checklists, PROJECT_STATUS has narrative

### 6. No Topic-Based Assignment Rules
**Decision**: Don't prescribe "gemini does X, codex does Y"
**Rationale**: Assignments should be flexible based on specific needs
**Implementation**: Document default roles, but allow any assignment

---

## Files Removed/Consolidated

### Removed (Obsolete)
- `status/REVIEW_STATUS.md` - Replaced by filesystem queries
- Review dashboard concept - Not implemented

### Consolidated Into STANDARDS.md
- File organization (from FILE_ORGANIZATION_STANDARDS.md - kept original too)
- Review protocol (from REVIEW_PROTOCOL.md - kept original too)
- Code patterns (from IMPLEMENTATION_REGISTRY.md examples)
- Git workflow

---

## File Count Summary

| Location | Count | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Root *.md | 6 | README, ROADMAP, CLAUDE, codex, GEMINI, AGENTS (symlink) |
| /docs/ | 15 | Permanent documentation |
| /status/ | 2 | PROJECT_STATUS, RUNPOD_STATUS |
| /reviews/requests/ | 0 | Empty (ready for new requests) |
| /reviews/responses/ | 12 | Migrated from split structure |
| /tasks/pending/ | 14 | All now have assignments |

---

## Benefits of New Structure

### Prevents Re-Implementation ‚úÖ
- IMPLEMENTATION_REGISTRY: Check first
- KNOWN_BUGS_AND_FIXES: Prevent regression
- Clear file:line references

### Single Source of Truth ‚úÖ
- README: Goals (one place)
- ROADMAP: Milestones (one checklist)
- PROJECT_STATUS: Context (one narrative)
- STANDARDS: How we work (one document)

### Clear Information Hierarchy ‚úÖ
```
Goals (README)
  ‚Üì
Progress (ROADMAP)
  ‚Üì
Standards (STANDARDS.md)
  ‚Üì
Current Context (PROJECT_STATUS)
  ‚Üì
Details (Registry, Specs, Code)
```

### Flexible Assignment ‚úÖ
- Any agent can be assigned any work
- Clear queue-checking mechanism
- No rigid topic rules
- Mandatory assignment prevents ambiguity

### No State Duplication ‚úÖ
- Filesystem is the database
- No dashboards to maintain
- Query directly with grep
- Status from file locations, not separate tracking

---

## Migration Impact

**Breaking changes**: None (for humans)
**For agents**: Updated queue-checking commands (grep patterns)
**For reviews**: New directory structure (old archived)
**For tasks**: Added assignment field (non-breaking addition)

---

## Next Session Expectations

### For Claude Code
```bash
# Session start
cat README.md          # Understand goals
cat ROADMAP.md         # Check progress
cat status/PROJECT_STATUS.md  # Get context

# Find work
grep -l "Assigned To: claude_code" tasks/claude_code/pending/*.md
grep -l "Assigned Reviewers.*claude_code" reviews/requests/*.md

# Before coding
cat docs/IMPLEMENTATION_REGISTRY.md
cat docs/KNOWN_BUGS_AND_FIXES.md
```

### For Gemini/Codex
```bash
# Session start
cat README.md          # Understand goals
cat ROADMAP.md         # Check progress

# Find work
grep -l "Assigned Reviewers.*{your_name}" reviews/requests/*.md
grep -l "Assigned To: {your_name}" tasks/claude_code/pending/*.md

# Review response
# Create: reviews/responses/YYYYMMDD_topic_{your_name}.md
```

---

## Documentation Consolidation

**STANDARDS.md now contains**:
- File organization (from FILE_ORGANIZATION_STANDARDS)
- Code standards (patterns from IMPLEMENTATION_REGISTRY)
- Documentation standards
- Review system (from REVIEW_PROTOCOL)
- Assignment system (new)
- Git workflow

**Other docs remain** for detailed reference:
- IMPLEMENTATION_REGISTRY: Script catalog
- KNOWN_BUGS_AND_FIXES: Bug history
- BASE_MODEL_TRUTH: Chat template issue
- Etc.

STANDARDS provides overview + quick reference, detailed docs provide depth.

---

## Success Metrics

1. ‚úÖ Root directory: 32 ‚Üí 6 files
2. ‚úÖ Single navigation hub (README)
3. ‚úÖ Single standards doc (STANDARDS.md)
4. ‚úÖ Unified review system (single queue)
5. ‚úÖ Universal assignment (all work items)
6. ‚úÖ No state duplication (filesystem = truth)
7. ‚úÖ Clear DAG (entry points ‚Üí shared docs)
8. ‚úÖ All agents check both queues

---

**Restructuring complete!** Documentation now has clear hierarchy, minimal duplication, and robust assignment system.
