# Documentation Restructuring - Complete

**Date**: 2025-10-03

## What Was Done

### ✅ Created New Core Files
1. **ROADMAP.md** - Milestone checklist (✅ done / ⏳ doing / 📋 todo)
2. **docs/STANDARDS.md** - Consolidated all standards (files, code, docs, reviews, assignments, git)
3. **reviews/README.md** - Unified review system documentation

### ✅ Restructured Entry Points
1. **README.md** - Goals + navigation only (no status/implementation details)
2. **CLAUDE.md** - Minimal: role + "read README first" + check both queues
3. **codex.md** - Minimal: role + "read README first" + check both queues
4. **GEMINI.md** - Minimal: role + "read README first" + check both queues

### ✅ Updated Status Files
1. **status/PROJECT_STATUS.md** - Minimal narrative (context, not checklists)
2. **status/RUNPOD_STATUS.md** - Infrastructure details (unchanged)

### ✅ Migrated Review System
- Created `/reviews/requests/` (single queue)
- Created `/reviews/responses/` (all responses)
- Migrated 12 review files from split structure
- Archived old `/reviews/{gemini,codex}/` directories
- Removed REVIEW_STATUS.md dashboard (query filesystem instead)

### ✅ Enhanced Task System
- Added `**Assigned To**: claude_code` to all 14 pending tasks
- Enables flexible assignment in future
- All agents now check both queues (tasks + reviews)

### ✅ Updated Supporting Docs
- docs/AGENT_STARTUP_CHECKLIST.md - Updated with new structure
- docs/FILE_ORGANIZATION_STANDARDS.md - Still exists (referenced by STANDARDS)
- docs/REVIEW_PROTOCOL.md - Still exists (referenced by STANDARDS)

## Key Features

### DAG Architecture
Every entry point starts with "read README for goals", then points to specialized docs.

### No Duplication
- README: Goals only
- ROADMAP: Milestones only
- PROJECT_STATUS: Context only
- STANDARDS: How we work (consolidated)

### Filesystem = Truth
- No dashboards to maintain
- Query with grep for current state
- File locations indicate status

### Universal Assignment
- Tasks: `Assigned To` field (mandatory)
- Reviews: `Assigned Reviewers` field (mandatory)
- All agents check both queues
- Flexible (anyone can be assigned anything)

### Minimal Agent Configs
- Role definition (3-4 lines)
- "Read README first"
- Queue check commands
- Pointers to shared docs

---

## Queue Check Commands

All agents use these at session start:

```bash
# Find tasks assigned to you
grep -l "Assigned To: {agent_name}" tasks/claude_code/pending/*.md

# Find reviews assigned to you
grep -l "Assigned Reviewers.*{agent_name}" reviews/requests/*.md
```

Examples:
- claude_code: `grep -l "Assigned To: claude_code" tasks/claude_code/pending/*.md`
- gemini: `grep -l "Assigned Reviewers.*gemini" reviews/requests/*.md`
- codex: `grep -l "Assigned Reviewers.*codex" reviews/requests/*.md`

---

## Comparison to Original Concerns

### "Re-implementation problem" ✅ SOLVED
- IMPLEMENTATION_REGISTRY.md: Check before coding
- KNOWN_BUGS_AND_FIXES.md: Check before debugging
- File:line references throughout

### "Reproducing old bugs" ✅ SOLVED
- KNOWN_BUGS_AND_FIXES.md: Complete bug history
- Chat template issue: Documented with sentinel tests
- Regression prevention checklists

### "Multiple overlapping docs" ✅ SOLVED
- Single README (goals)
- Single ROADMAP (milestones)
- Single PROJECT_STATUS (context)
- Single STANDARDS (how we work)

### "Documentation as DAG" ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- Clear entry points (README, agent configs)
- Navigation hub (README)
- Shared resources (STANDARDS, ROADMAP)
- No circular dependencies

### "Review tracking unclear" ✅ SOLVED
- Unified queue (/reviews/requests/)
- Mandatory reviewer assignment
- Clear completion criteria (all assigned respond)
- Filesystem query (no separate index)

## Files Archived

Moved to `/archive/`:
- decisions/20251003_reorganization_summary.md (first reorganization)
- reviews/20250912_split_structure/ (old review system)
- reviews/P0_FIXES_REVIEW_SUMMARY*.md
- (Previous: 18 docs archived in first round)

**Restructuring complete!** Project now has clean DAG architecture with minimal duplication and robust assignment system.
