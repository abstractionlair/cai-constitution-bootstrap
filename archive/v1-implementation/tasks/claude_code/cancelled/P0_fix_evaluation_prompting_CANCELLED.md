# CANCELLED: Fix Evaluation Prompt Mismatch

**Priority**: CANCELLED
**Created**: 2024-12-28 16:15
**Cancelled**: 2024-12-28 16:35
**Reason**: Codex reviewer misunderstood Stage 1 goals

## Why This Task Was Cancelled

The Codex reviewer incorrectly identified this as a problem. After analysis, the current evaluation approach is **correct as designed**.

## The Misunderstanding

Codex claimed: "Base model gets raw instructions which disadvantages it"

Reality: **That's the entire point of Stage 1!**

- Base model SHOULD fail with raw instructions (it only knows text completion)
- Trained model SHOULD succeed with raw instructions (we trained it to follow them)
- The improvement IS learning to follow instructions

## What Stage 1 Is Training

We're teaching the base model to recognize instruction patterns like:
- "Answer this question: X"
- "Complete this sentence: Y"
- "Write a sentence about Z"

And respond appropriately instead of just completing the text.

## Correct Evaluation Approach

Both models should be tested with the SAME raw instructions:
- Base model + raw instruction = ~50% success (baseline)
- Trained model + raw instruction = 95%+ success (target)

This measures whether training worked.

## What Would Be Wrong

If we gave the base model completion-style prompts during evaluation:
- We'd be helping it cheat
- We wouldn't measure the actual improvement
- We'd be testing different things for each model

## Conclusion

**NO CHANGES NEEDED** to evaluation prompting. The current approach correctly measures whether the model learned to follow instructions.
