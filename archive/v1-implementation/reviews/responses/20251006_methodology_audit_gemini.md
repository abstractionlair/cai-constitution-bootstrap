## Severity Summary
- **Critical**: 2
- **High**: 2
- **Medium**: 0
- **Low**: 0

---

## Priority Recommendations
1.  **Fix Critical Contamination Bug (Finding 3)**: Immediately refactor `scripts/generate_preference_pairs_logprob.py` to use the `CleanModelLoader`. This bug corrupts the DPO dataset and is the highest priority issue.
2.  **Fix SFT Data Generation (Finding 1)**: Deprecate or completely rewrite `scripts/generate_stage1_sft_data.py` to align with the specification. Use a powerful external LLM to generate both instructions and responses.
3.  **Fix DPO Data Generation Methodology (Finding 2)**: Refactor `scripts/generate_preference_pairs_logprob.py` to implement Best-of-N sampling and generate pairs with realistic, hard negatives.
4.  **Halt All Training (Findings 4 & 5)**: Do not run any SFT or DPO training until the data generation scripts are fixed and have produced new, high-quality datasets.
5.  **Audit Remaining Scripts**: The issues found are systemic. A thorough audit of the remaining data generation and evaluation scripts is warranted to check for similar deviations from specifications and standards.

## Methodology Gaps
- **Instruction Generation**: The current implementation uses simplistic templates, completely missing the specified methodology of using a powerful LLM to bootstrap a diverse instruction set.
- **Response Generation (SFT)**: The current implementation uses the untrained base model to generate its own training data, which is methodologically unsound.
- **Preference Pair Generation (DPO)**: The current implementation fails to use Best-of-N sampling and hard negatives, two key strategies documented as critical for DPO success.
- **Code Standards**: A core utility (`CleanModelLoader`) was ignored, re-introducing a critical, fixed bug, indicating a process failure.

### Finding 2: DPO Data Generation Lacks Best-of-N and Hard Negatives

**File:Line**: `scripts/generate_preference_pairs_logprob.py`

**Issue**: The script does not implement two of the key recommended strategies for creating high-quality preference pairs: Best-of-N (BoN) sampling and the use of hard negatives.

**Expected** (per `docs/POST_TRAINING_APPROACHES.md`):
- The DPO data generation process should use Best-of-N sampling (generate *k* responses, pick the best, and create *k-1* pairs).
- Pairs should be constructed with "hard negatives" to effectively teach the model subtle distinctions.

**Actual** (in code):
- The script evaluates only a single response per instruction (no BoN).
- When a "good" response is found, it is paired against trivial, templated "bad" responses (e.g., "I cannot help with that request."), which are not hard negatives.

**Impact**:
- [x] **High** - Affects correctness or validity of results. The quality of the DPO dataset will be significantly lower than planned, leading to a less capable model. The model will not learn the fine-grained distinctions that DPO is meant to teach.

**Recommendation**:
- Refactor `scripts/generate_preference_pairs_logprob.py` to:
    1.  Accept a parameter `k` for Best-of-N sampling.
    2.  For each instruction, call the SFT model `k` times with non-zero temperature to generate diverse candidate responses.
    3.  Use the log-probability judging method to identify the "best" response out of the `k` candidates.
    4.  Create `k-1` preference pairs by pairing the chosen response against each of the other `k-1` candidates (which serve as realistic, hard negatives).

### Finding 3: Critical Bug Re-introduced by Ignoring CleanModelLoader

**File:Line**: `scripts/generate_preference_pairs_logprob.py`, line 150 (`load_model_with_retry`)

**Issue**: This script contains its own manual model loading function (`load_model_with_retry`) and completely ignores the mandatory `CleanModelLoader` utility. This re-introduces a critical, fixed bug related to chat template contamination.

**Expected** (per `docs/STANDARDS.md` and recent project-wide migration):
- All scripts that load a base model MUST use the `scripts/utils/clean_model_loader.py` utility to prevent a known contamination issue. This is a strict, project-wide policy.

**Actual** (in code):
- The script reimplements its own model loading logic, bypassing all the safety checks and contamination prevention measures provided by `CleanModelLoader`.

**Impact**:
- [x] **Critical** - Invalidates experiments or training. The judge model loaded by this script is likely contaminated with chat templates, making its log-probability judgments unreliable and invalid. This corrupts the entire DPO dataset at its source.

**Recommendation**:
1.  Delete the `load_model_with_retry` function from this script immediately.
2.  Refactor the script to use `CleanModelLoader` to load the judge model, consistent with all other scripts in the repository.

### Finding 4: SFT Training Script is Correct but Blocked by Flawed Data

**File:Line**: `scripts/train_stage1_sft.py`

**Issue**: The SFT training script itself is well-implemented. It correctly uses `CleanModelLoader`, LoRA, and a sophisticated custom data collator for loss masking. However, it is designed to consume the data produced by `scripts/generate_stage1_sft_data.py`, which has been identified as methodologically flawed (Finding 1).

**Expected** (per `specs/stage_1_explicit_instructions.md`):
- The training script should fine-tune the base model on a high-quality, diverse dataset of instruction-response pairs generated by a powerful external LLM.

**Actual** (in code):
- The script is correct, but it will be fed a low-quality, low-diversity dataset generated from templates and the untrained base model. The principle of "garbage in, garbage out" applies here.

**Impact**:
- [x] **High** - Affects correctness or validity of results. Running this script on the current data will waste GPU resources to produce a poorly performing model. The script's correctness is negated by the flawed data pipeline.

**Recommendation**:
- No changes are needed for `scripts/train_stage1_sft.py` itself.
- This script should not be run until the data generation process (`generate_stage1_sft_data.py`) is fixed to produce a high-quality dataset as per the specification.
- Once the data generation is fixed, this script is ready for use.

### Finding 5: DPO Training Script is Correct but Blocked by Flawed and Corrupted Data

**File:Line**: `scripts/train_stage1_dpo_improved.py`

**Issue**: The DPO training script is well-implemented, correctly using `CleanModelLoader` for the base model and the `DPOTrainer` from the TRL library. However, it is designed to consume the preference pair dataset generated by `scripts/generate_preference_pairs_logprob.py`.

**Expected** (per `docs/POST_TRAINING_APPROACHES.md`):
- The DPO script should train on a high-quality dataset of preference pairs, ideally generated using Best-of-N sampling with hard negatives, and produced by a contamination-free judge model.

**Actual** (in code):
- The script is correct, but it will be fed a low-quality dataset that is (a) not generated using Best-of-N, (b) uses trivial negatives (Finding 2), and (c) is likely corrupted by a judge model loaded without contamination prevention (Finding 3).

**Impact**:
- [x] **Critical** - Invalidates experiments or training. Running this script will waste significant GPU resources to train a model on a flawed, low-quality, and corrupted dataset. The resulting model's performance will be poor and the experimental results will be invalid.

**Recommendation**:
- No changes are needed for `scripts/train_stage1_dpo_improved.py` itself.
- This script must not be run until the preference pair generation script (`generate_preference_pairs_logprob.py`) is completely refactored to fix the methodological flaws and the critical contamination bug.

### Finding 1: SFT Data Generation Contradicts Specification

**File:Line**: `scripts/generate_stage1_sft_data.py`

**Issue**: The script generates SFT data using a small set of hardcoded templates and the local, untrained base model for responses. This directly contradicts the specification's requirement to use a powerful, external LLM (like GPT-4/Claude 3) to generate both diverse instructions and high-quality responses.

**Expected** (per `specs/stage_1_explicit_instructions.md`):
- Instructions should be generated by a capable, external LLM based on meta-prompts to ensure diversity and complexity.
- High-quality responses should also be generated by this capable, external LLM to serve as gold-standard examples for SFT.

**Actual** (in code):
- Instructions are created by combining a limited set of hardcoded Python templates and topics (`self.instruction_types`).
- Responses are generated by the local `Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B` base model, which has not yet been trained to follow instructions well. It even falls back to placeholder text.

**Impact**:
- [x] **Critical** - Invalidates experiments or training. Using the untrained base model to generate its own training data is methodologically unsound and will produce a low-quality dataset, leading to a poorly performing SFT model. The lack of instruction diversity from templates further limits the model's capabilities.

**Recommendation**:
1.  **Deprecate `scripts/generate_stage1_sft_data.py`**.
2.  Create a new script that implements the specified methodology:
    - It should take a set of meta-prompts as input.
    - It should use an API (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic) to call a powerful external LLM to generate a diverse set of instructions.
    - It should then use the same external LLM to generate high-quality responses for each instruction.
    - The output should be the high-quality instruction-response pairs for SFT.
