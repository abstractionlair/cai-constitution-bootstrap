# Final Pre-Deployment Review Request for Codex

**Date:** 2025-01-10
**Type:** Pre-Deployment Technical Validation
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Final Gate Before GPU Deployment

## Status Update

- All previously identified issues have been addressed
- P0: Persistent eval sets implemented ✅
- P1: Few-shot diversity enhanced ✅  
- P2: Documentation links added ✅
- Independent review confirmed fixes are correct

## Pre-Deployment Checklist Review

Please validate the complete Stage 1 pipeline is production-ready:

### 1. Data Generation Pipeline (`generate_stage1_data.py`)
- Base model prompting strategy
- Train/eval data separation
- Constitutional critique generation
- DPO preference pair creation

### 2. Training Pipeline (`train_stage1_dpo.py`)
- LoRA configuration for 32B model
- DPO hyperparameters
- Checkpoint management
- Memory optimization for A100 80GB

### 3. Evaluation System (`evaluate_stage1.py`, `baseline_assessment.py`)
- Persistent held-out sets
- Paired statistical analysis
- 95% success gate implementation
- Baseline comparison

### 4. Core Utilities
- `data_formatter.py`: Completion-style prompting
- `model_loader.py`: Consistent 8-bit loading
- `metrics.py`: Instruction-following evaluation

### 5. Deployment Configuration
- RunPod compatibility
- Error recovery/resumability
- Progress tracking/logging
- Result persistence

## Specific Concerns

- Any remaining data leakage risks?
- Will 32B model with LoRA fit in 80GB at 4-bit?
- Are all template placeholder issues resolved?
- Is the 95% gate properly enforced?

## Methodology Validation

Does the implementation correctly follow the sequential bootstrapping architecture where Stage 1 teaches instruction-following (NOT full CAI)?

## Verdict Needed

**GREEN LIGHT for GPU deployment or REMAINING BLOCKERS?**

This is the final review gate before committing resources. Please flag ANY concerns.

## Response Format

Please provide:
1. **VERDICT:** GREEN LIGHT / YELLOW LIGHT / RED LIGHT
2. **Blockers:** Any issues that MUST be fixed before deployment
3. **Warnings:** Issues that should be monitored during runs
4. **Suggestions:** Improvements for future iterations
5. **Confidence:** Your confidence level (1-10) in deployment success
