# Implementation Strategy

## Core Concept
We're building a pipeline where a model teaches itself to be more aligned by critiquing and revising its own outputs according to constitutional principles.

## Quantization Strategy

### For Training
- **Method**: QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation)
- **Base Model**: 4-bit quantized (saves memory)
- **LoRA Adapters**: 16-bit or bfloat16 (trainable parameters)
- **Why**: Proven to work well, memory efficient, allows larger batches
- **Memory Usage**: ~16GB for base model, ~5-10GB for adapters and gradients

### For Inference
- **During Generation**: Can use 4-bit, 8-bit, or 16-bit (we have 80GB!)
- **For Final Model**: Can quantize to 4-bit for deployment
- **Flexibility**: Test different quantization levels if needed

## Milestone Strategy

### Why Start with ONE Example?
1. **Verify Core Mechanism**: Does self-critique actually work?
2. **Debug Cheaply**: Fix issues when they cost $0.87, not $8.70
3. **Build Confidence**: See the quality before scaling
4. **Quick Iteration**: 30-minute feedback loop

### Scaling Philosophy
- **1 → 10 → 100 → 1000+**
- Each step validates the previous
- Clear go/no-go decisions
- Costs scale with confidence

## Expected Outcomes by Stage

### Stage 1: Explicit Instructions (6-8 hours)
- **Cost**: ~$10-14
- **Output**: 500-1000 instruction-following examples
- **Model**: Can follow explicit instructions (95%+ accuracy)
- **Enables**: Generation of questions and examples for Stage 2

### Stage 2: Implicit Instructions (6-8 hours)  
- **Cost**: ~$10-14
- **Output**: Model that understands questions ARE instructions
- **Model**: Handles both "Answer this:" and bare "What is X?"
- **Enables**: Natural interaction for data generation

### Stage 3: Generation Tasks (6-8 hours)
- **Cost**: ~$10-14
- **Output**: Model that can create examples on demand
- **Model**: "Generate a question about X" → produces good examples
- **Enables**: Creating diverse prompts for later stages

### Stage 4: Evaluation Tasks (6-8 hours)
- **Cost**: ~$10-14
- **Output**: Model that can judge quality
- **Model**: "Is this helpful?" → accurate evaluation
- **Enables**: Critique phase of CAI

### Stage 5: Revision Tasks (6-8 hours)
- **Cost**: ~$10-14
- **Output**: Model that can improve text
- **Model**: "Make this better:" → improved version
- **Enables**: Revision phase of CAI

### Stage 6: Constitutional Integration (10+ hours)
- **Cost**: ~$20-30
- **Output**: Fully aligned model
- **Model**: Constitutionally aware and helpful
- **Result**: Publication-ready demonstration

## Technical Choices Explained

### Why Qwen-2.5-32B?
- Sweet spot for capability (can self-critique)
- Fits comfortably in 80GB even with QLoRA
- Good base model quality
- Apache 2.0 license (permissive)

### Why QLoRA instead of full fine-tuning?
- **Memory**: Full fine-tuning needs ~200GB+ for 32B model
- **Speed**: QLoRA is actually faster (fewer parameters to update)
- **Quality**: Minimal degradation vs full fine-tuning
- **Cost**: Can use single GPU instead of multi-GPU setup

### Why DPO instead of PPO/RLHF?
- **Simplicity**: No reward model needed
- **Stability**: No RL training instabilities
- **Efficiency**: Direct preference optimization
- **Memory**: Lower memory requirements

## What Success Looks Like

### Technical Success
- Pipeline runs end-to-end without human intervention
- Model successfully critiques its own outputs
- Revised answers are measurably better
- Training improves preference for good answers

### Research Success
- Demonstrate CAI works at 32B scale
- Show improvement on safety benchmarks
- Maintain capability on helpfulness benchmarks
- Produce reproducible results

### Publication Success
- Clear methodology documentation
- Compelling results
- Open-source code and data
- Interesting insights about self-bootstrapping

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Risk**: Pipeline might fail at scale
- **Mitigation**: Test with 1, then 10, then 100 examples

### Quality Risks
- **Risk**: Critiques might be poor quality
- **Mitigation**: Manual inspection at each milestone

### Cost Risks
- **Risk**: Might burn through budget on failed runs
- **Mitigation**: Start small, scale gradually

## Next Steps
1. Claude Code implements Milestone 0 (single example)
2. We review the output together
3. Decision: Proceed to Milestone 1?
4. Iterate and scale
