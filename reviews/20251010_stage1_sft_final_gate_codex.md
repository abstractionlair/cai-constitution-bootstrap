Summary: ⚠️ MODIFY – Clean obvious truncations, then re-run QC before Stage 1 SFT.

🚨 CRITICAL
- `data/stage1_sft_data_final.jsonl:517` (also 529, 1369, 3559, 5994 and 60 more): Multiple accepted examples end mid-thought (e.g., “It involves two main stages:” with no stages, or “Here's a simple Python program…” with no code). These are true response failures that slipped past the pair critic and will teach the model to omit the actual answer—particularly damaging for code/tasks. Filter or regenerate the affected rows (≈66/6009 ≈1.1%), re-run QC, and ensure the critic catches this pattern going forward (e.g., flag responses ending with `:` or lacking alphanumeric tokens after the colon).

⚠️ HIGH
- `data/stage1_sft_data_final.jsonl:61` (also 184, 462, 480, 649, 2622, 4419, 5545): A small cluster of “True/False” style outputs now lacks the original instruction prefix (e.g., “True or False:” trimmed away), leaving bare factual statements with the target label “True”. These look like parsing side-effects and risk confusing the model about the task intent. Either restore the full prompt text during cleaning or drop these few entries alongside the truncation fix.

💡 SUGGESTIONS
- Token median: The QC scripts treat “tokens” as whitespace-delimited words, where the final dataset sits at median≈34. The reported 57-token median (HF BPE) explains the discrepancy. Align future QC reports with the spec definition to avoid false alarms.
- Training config: After data cleanup, the proposed setup (lr=1e-4, 2 epochs, effective batch≈8) is reasonable for 6k examples. Still, log train/val loss and plan to halve LR or stop after 1 epoch if eval gains plateau.
- Pre-fix shards (seeds 300–311) look consistent post-repair—metadata shows `repaired: true` and spot-checks confirm no delimiter leakage. Document this acceptance in the manifest once the truncation issue is resolved.
