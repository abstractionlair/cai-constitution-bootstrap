# Review Request: Stage 1 Implementation Verification
Date: 2024-12-28
Priority: HIGH

## Context
Claude Code has applied fixes to Stage 1 implementation based on your previous review. Some issues remain unclear and need verification.

## Files to Review
- `/Users/scottmcguire/MaximalCAI/scripts/generate_stage1_data.py`
- `/Users/scottmcguire/MaximalCAI/scripts/utils/data_formatter.py`
- `/Users/scottmcguire/MaximalCAI/constitution.yaml`

## Specific Questions

### 1. Constitution Usage
**Previous Issue**: Constitution loaded but not used in critique prompts
**Fix Applied**: Unknown - code structure changed
**Please Verify**: 
- Is the `constitution.yaml` file actually being used in the critique prompts?
- Search for where `critique_prompt` is constructed
- Confirm principles from YAML are incorporated, not just hardcoded

### 2. Instruction Diversity
**Previous Issue**: Only ~30 instruction templates, repeated
**Fix Applied**: Unclear
**Please Check**:
- Count unique instruction templates in `data_formatter.py`
- Are there still only ~30 base templates?
- Is the diversity sufficient for 500-1000 training examples?

### 3. Technical Precision Check
**Please Verify**:
- Baseline assessment uses what precision for model loading?
- Post-training evaluation uses what precision?
- Are they consistent for fair comparison?

## Expected Response Format
For each issue, please indicate:
- ✅ Fixed properly
- ❌ Still broken
- ⚠️ Partially fixed (explain)

Include specific line numbers or code snippets where relevant.
