# Review Request: Stage 1 Methodology Verification
Date: 2024-12-28
Priority: HIGH

## Context
Stage 1 implementation has been partially fixed based on your previous review. Need to verify scientific methodology for the bootstrapping experiment.

## Files to Review
- `/Users/scottmcguire/MaximalCAI/scripts/baseline_assessment.py`
- `/Users/scottmcguire/MaximalCAI/scripts/evaluate_stage1.py`
- `/Users/scottmcguire/MaximalCAI/scripts/generate_stage1_data.py`

## Methodology Questions

### 1. Baseline Fairness
**Issue**: Are we comparing apples to apples?
**Check**:
- What precision does baseline assessment use for the model?
- What precision does post-training evaluation use?
- Is the evaluation methodology identical between baseline and post-training?
- Could precision differences artificially inflate improvement metrics?

### 2. Data Quality for Bootstrapping
**Critical for Publication**: Is the training data diverse enough?
**Please Assess**:
- With only ~30 base templates, will we get sufficient diversity for 500-1000 examples?
- Will the model overfit to specific phrasings?
- Is this a threat to the validity of our bootstrapping claim?
- Suggested minimum diversity for credible results?

### 3. Success Gate Validity
**95% threshold**: Is this scientifically justified?
**Consider**:
- Is 95% on 100 test examples statistically significant?
- Should we require confidence intervals?
- What's the risk of false positives (proceeding when we shouldn't)?
- Do we need multiple evaluation runs for robustness?

### 4. Constitutional Principles Integration
**Core to CAI methodology**: Are we actually using constitutional principles?
**Verify**:
- Is the constitution.yaml being used or just loaded?
- Are critiques actually referencing constitutional principles?
- Is this true Constitutional AI or just preference learning?

## Expected Response
For each issue:
1. Assessment of current implementation
2. Impact on scientific validity
3. Minimum changes needed for publication-quality claims
4. Nice-to-have improvements

Please flag any "FATAL" issues that would invalidate our core claims about automated CAI.
