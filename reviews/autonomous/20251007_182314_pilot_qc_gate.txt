Decision: ITERATE  
Recommendation: Combine Option C (tighten generation sampling to get shorter, on-task completions) with targeted Option B tweaks (explicit stop sequences/trimming rules) before adding Option D’s higher instruction multiplier once QC clears.  
Reasoning: Stage-1 spec blocks scaling until runaway (<5%) and token-limit (<10%) rates pass, and both failures trace to overly long generations rather than unclear root causes. Lowering temperature/top_p and enforcing stop cues should bring the base model back into the expected completion regime, after which a larger instruction over-generation factor can recover volume without masking QC issues.  
Priority: 1) Retune generation hyperparameters (temperature ≤0.3, tighter top_p/repetition penalty) and add stop strings so completions self-terminate; 2) Re-run pilot with augmented cleanup, inspecting runaway/token-limit metrics; 3) Once metrics clear thresholds, raise instruction multiplier (e.g., 2×) to hit the 100-example target.
