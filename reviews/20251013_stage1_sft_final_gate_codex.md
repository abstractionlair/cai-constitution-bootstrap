Summary: ✅ GO – Final QC blocks cleared; Stage 1 SFT training may proceed.

🚨 CRITICAL
- None.

⚠️ HIGH
- None.

💡 SUGGESTIONS
- Training pool still has repeated prompts (e.g., “What is the difference between weather and climate?” appears 13× in `data/stage1_sft_data_final_clean.jsonl`). This is acceptable for SFT but consider capping repeats when you regenerate for Stage 1.5 or DPO so gradients are not dominated by a narrow slice of topics.
- When you rerun data generation, persist the updated truncation audit alongside `stage1_sft_data_final_clean.jsonl` so later gates can diff the QC output without re-executing the checks.

Validation
- Confirmed `data/test_instructions_clean.jsonl` now contains 300 unique instructions with zero overlap against the current SFT training instructions (scripted audit).
- Re-ran the truncation heuristic across `data/stage1_sft_data_final_clean.jsonl`; zero colon/list-tail/short-response flags after filtering the two mid-list tails.
- Verified the enhanced truncation detector is wired into both pipelines at `scripts/generate_stage1_pilot_data.py:654` and `scripts/generate_diversity_guided.py:312`, matching the regex we discussed on Oct 11.
