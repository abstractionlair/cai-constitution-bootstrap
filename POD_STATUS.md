# RunPod Status

## Current Status: STOPPED (2025-09-11)
Pod stopped by user to avoid unattended charges.

## When Restarting:
1. **Port will change!** Check RunPod dashboard for new SSH port
2. Update: `export RUNPOD_PORT=<new_port>`
3. Use direct SSH: `ssh -p $RUNPOD_PORT -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 root@195.26.233.96`

## What's Ready on Pod:
- ✅ DPO-trained model checkpoint at: `/workspace/runs/stage1_20250911_131105/code/checkpoints/stage1_dpo_simple/`
- ✅ Evaluation script at: `/workspace/runs/stage1_20250911_131105/code/scripts/evaluate_final.py`
- ✅ Held-out test instructions at: `/workspace/runs/stage1_20250911_131105/code/artifacts/held_out_test_instructions.jsonl`
- ✅ Training artifacts and preference pairs

## Next Task When Resuming:
Run comprehensive evaluation on 130 held-out test instructions:
```bash
cd /workspace/runs/stage1_20250911_131105/code
python scripts/evaluate_final.py
```

This will compare base model vs DPO-trained model on new test data to see if training improved instruction following.

## Progress Summary:
- Generated 100 instructions and responses
- Created 188 preference pairs using A/B log-probability evaluation
- Successfully trained DPO model (4.7 minutes)
- Generated 130 held-out test instructions (no overlap with training)
- Created strict evaluation criteria to detect instruction-following failures
- **Started evaluation but stopped** - base model was loading when pod stopped

## Cost Note:
Pod was running for several hours at $1.74/hour. Good call stopping it!
