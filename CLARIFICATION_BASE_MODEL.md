# Clarification: Base Model Capabilities

## The Confusion
- **Gemini's View**: Base models have NO instruction-following ability
- **Our Assumption**: Base models might have 60-80% capability
- **Reality**: We don't know until we test!

## What "Base" Really Means

### Qwen Model Variants
- `Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B` - TRUE base model (pretrained only)
- `Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct` - Instruction-tuned version

We're using the TRUE base model, which likely has:
- ✅ Good at completions ("The capital of France is...")
- ❓ Might not answer questions ("What is the capital?")
- ❌ Probably won't follow instructions ("Answer this:")

## Updated Approach

### Step 1: Baseline Assessment (NEW PRIORITY!)
```python
# Test what the base model can ACTUALLY do
test_categories = {
    'completions': ["The capital is...", "2+2 equals..."],        # Likely works
    'questions': ["What is X?", "How does Y work?"],              # Might not work
    'instructions': ["Answer this:", "Complete this:"],           # Probably fails
    'commands': ["Tell me X", "Explain Y"]                        # Probably fails
}

# Measure baseline
baseline_scores = evaluate_base_model(test_categories)
# Likely: completions=80%, questions=30%, instructions=10%, commands=10%
```

### Step 2: Stage 1 Training
- Now we know what we're starting from
- Can show true improvement
- More honest about what we're accomplishing

### Step 3: Document the Delta
```python
results = {
    'completions': {'before': 80, 'after': 95, 'delta': +15},
    'questions': {'before': 30, 'after': 95, 'delta': +65},
    'instructions': {'before': 10, 'after': 95, 'delta': +85},  # Big win!
    'commands': {'before': 10, 'after': 95, 'delta': +85}
}
```

## Why This Matters

If the base model truly has minimal instruction-following:
1. **Our work is more impressive** - Teaching from near-zero
2. **Bootstrapping is harder** - Can't rely on existing capabilities
3. **Stage 1 is critical** - Must work or everything fails
4. **Publication angle stronger** - "From raw model to constitutional AI"

## Action Items for Claude Code

1. **FIRST PRIORITY**: Run baseline assessment
2. Load `Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B` (NOT the Instruct version!)
3. Test all prompt types
4. Report actual capabilities
5. THEN proceed with Stage 1 training

## Expected Timeline Impact

- Add 1-2 hours for thorough baseline testing
- Worth it for honest assessment
- Makes our claims defensible
- Shows true improvement achieved

This baseline assessment is now the FIRST thing to do!
