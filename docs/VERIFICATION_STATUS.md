# Verification Status: Critical Claims

This document tracks verification status of critical claims made in roadmap and documentation.

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-03

## 1. Base Model Completion Mode (No Chat Template Contamination)

**Claim** (ROADMAP.md line 43, 47):
- "Base model completion mode verified (no instruction template leakage)"
- "Base model completion mode implementation (CompletionStylePrompts)"

### Current Status: ⚠️ PARTIALLY VERIFIED

### Evidence Found

#### ✅ Documentation Exists
- **BASE_MODEL_TRUTH.md**: Comprehensive documentation of contamination issue
- **Sentinel tests defined**: 4 tests that base model should fail if clean
- **Contamination checklist**: 7-point audit checklist provided

#### ✅ Test Script Exists
- **File**: `scripts/test_base_model_ultra_clean.py` (created Sep 12, 18KB)
- **Sets chat_template = None**: Line 49 ✅
- **Uses add_special_tokens=False**: Line 128 ✅
- **Implements sentinel tests**: Lines 79-120 ✅
- **Status**: NOT YET RUN (no output artifacts found)

#### ✅ Clean Implementation Exists
- **File**: `scripts/generate_stage1_sft_data.py` (Sep 12, most recent)
- **Sets chat_template = None**: Line 130 ✅
- **Uses CompletionStylePrompts**: Imported and used ✅
- **Status**: Script is correct

#### ✅ CompletionStylePrompts Exists
- **File**: `scripts/utils/data_formatter.py`
- **Class exists**: CompletionStylePrompts ✅
- **Few-shot implementation**: create_instruction_generation_prompt() ✅
- **Completion-style prompting**: create_response_generation_prompt() ✅

#### ⚠️ Data Generation Script Uncertainty
**Problem**: Multiple generation scripts exist with different dates:

| Script | Date | Chat Template Disabled? | Status |
|--------|------|-------------------------|--------|
| generate_stage1_sft_data.py | Sep 12 | ✅ YES (line 130) | Clean |
| stage1_generate.py | Sep 11 | ❌ NO | Contaminated |
| stage1_generate_robust.py | Sep 11 | ❓ Unknown | Need check |
| generate_stage1_data.py | Sep 10 | ❓ Unknown | Need check |

**Existing data**:
- `data/stage1/train_instructions.jsonl` - Sep 10 (before clean script!)
- `artifacts/preference_pairs.jsonl` - Sep 11
- `artifacts/held_out_test_instructions_20250911_162708.jsonl` - Sep 11

**Timeline issue**: Most data (Sep 10-11) predates the verified clean script (Sep 12).

#### ❌ No Verification Run on Record
- test_base_model_ultra_clean.py has NOT been executed
- No output showing sentinel tests pass
- No confirmation that base model actually fails instruction tests

### What's Missing

1. **Execution evidence**: Need to run test_base_model_ultra_clean.py and show results
2. **Data provenance**: Need to determine which script generated existing data
3. **Contamination check on existing data**: Was Sep 10-11 data generated with clean approach?

### Action Items

Created task: `/tasks/claude_code/pending/P0_verify_base_model_cleanliness.md`

**Priority**: P0 - This is foundational. If contaminated, entire approach is invalid.

**Next steps**:
1. Check older scripts (stage1_generate_robust.py, generate_stage1_data.py) for chat_template handling
2. Run test_base_model_ultra_clean.py on GPU (local or RunPod)
3. Document which script generated Sep 10-11 data
4. Consider regenerating data if contaminated

## 2. Instruction-Following Data Generation

**Claim** (ROADMAP.md line 37-43):
- "200 SFT training examples generated"
- "188 preference pairs created"
- "130 held-out test instructions"
- "Few-shot completion prompting implemented"
- "Chat template contamination fix applied"

### Current Status: ⚠️ DATA EXISTS, CLEANLINESS UNCERTAIN

### Evidence Found

#### ✅ Data Files Exist
- `data/stage1/train_instructions.jsonl` (7.7K, Sep 10)
- `artifacts/preference_pairs.jsonl` (110K, Sep 11)
- `artifacts/held_out_test_instructions_20250911_162708.jsonl` (18K, Sep 11)

#### ⚠️ Data Cleanliness Uncertain
- Data predates verified clean script (Sep 12)
- Need to check which script was actually used
- Need to check if older scripts had contamination prevention

### What's Missing

1. **Script verification**: Which script generated the Sep 10-11 data?
2. **Contamination analysis**: Were those scripts clean?
3. **Data quality check**: Sample a few examples and verify they use completion-style prompting

### Action Items

Same task as above covers this: P0_verify_base_model_cleanliness.md

## 3. Implementation Registry Currency

**Claim** (Multiple locations):
- IMPLEMENTATION_REGISTRY.md should be updated after every script creation
- Should contain 40+ scripts

### Current Status: ⚠️ NEEDS AUDIT

### Evidence Found

#### ✅ Registry Exists
- **File**: `/docs/IMPLEMENTATION_REGISTRY.md`
- **Purpose**: Catalog all scripts to prevent re-implementation

#### ❓ Currency Unknown
- **Not checked**: Is registry up to date?
- **Not checked**: Does it list all current scripts?
- **Not checked**: Are script descriptions accurate?

### What's Missing

1. **Completeness check**: Compare registry to actual scripts in /scripts/
2. **Accuracy check**: Verify descriptions match implementations
3. **Usage tracking**: Add timestamps to know when last updated

### Action Items

**Lower priority** (P2) - Should be done but not blocking training.

Consider creating: `P2_audit_implementation_registry.md`

## Verification Checklist

Before marking items "done" in roadmap, ensure:

- [ ] Code/script exists ✅ (for base model: YES)
- [ ] Code is correct ✅ (for base model: YES)
- [ ] Code has been executed ❌ (for base model: NO)
- [ ] Execution results documented ❌ (for base model: NO)
- [ ] Results meet success criteria ❌ (for base model: NO)
- [ ] Evidence archived ❌ (for base model: NO)

**Current issue**: We have ✅✅❌❌❌❌ for base model verification.

Code exists and is correct, but has never been proven to work through execution.

## Recommendation

1. **Immediate** (P0): Run verification test and document results
2. **Immediate** (P0): Determine cleanliness of existing data
3. **Before training** (P0): Regenerate data with verified clean script if needed
4. **Maintenance** (P2): Audit IMPLEMENTATION_REGISTRY.md for currency

**Do NOT proceed to RunPod training** until P0 verification complete. Contaminated data would invalidate entire Stage 1.

## Template for Future Verifications

When claiming something is "done":

```markdown
## [Feature Name]

**Claim**: [What we claim is done]

**Evidence**:
1. Code exists: [file:line]
2. Code is correct: [verification method]
3. Code executed: [command + output]
4. Results meet criteria: [success metrics]
5. Results archived: [location]

**Verified by**: [who/when]
**Verification artifacts**: [file paths]
```

This ensures we don't confuse "implemented" with "verified working."
