# Session Summary: Data Remediation Complete (Oct 12, 2025)

## Status: ✅ READY FOR STAGE 1 SFT TRAINING

### Codex Decision
**GO** - Both blocking issues from Oct 11 review have been resolved and validated.

Review filed at: `reviews/20251013_stage1_sft_final_gate_codex.md`

---

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Test Set Contamination ✅
**Problem**: Only 137 unique test instructions (needed ≥300), 1 leaked instruction

**Resolution**:
- Deduplicated test set to 136 unique instructions
- Removed 1 leaked instruction
- Generated 164 additional unique instructions using diverse templates
- Validated zero train/test leakage

**Result**: `data/test_instructions_clean.jsonl` now contains 300 unique instructions with 0% leakage

### 2. Truncation Detection Enhancement ✅
**Problem**: Detector missed list endings like "5) Biomass Energy -" and "7. Professionalism -"

**Resolution**:
- Enhanced `is_truncated()` function with regex: `r'[\d\)\.]\s+\w+(\s+\w+)*\s*-\s*$'`
- Applied to both generation scripts:
  - `scripts/generate_stage1_pilot_data.py:654-668`
  - `scripts/generate_diversity_guided.py:312-326`
- Filtered training data with new heuristic
- Removed 2 truncated examples (lines 4025, 4611)

**Result**: `data/stage1_sft_data_final_clean.jsonl` now contains 5,467 pairs with 0% truncation

## Training Configuration (Ready to Use)

```python
# Model
base_model = "Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B"
quantization = "4bit"  # QLoRA

# LoRA parameters
lora_r = 16
lora_alpha = 16
lora_dropout = 0.1
target_modules = ["q_proj", "k_proj", "v_proj", "o_proj",
                  "gate_proj", "up_proj", "down_proj"]

# Training hyperparameters (per Codex Oct 10 recommendations)
learning_rate = 1e-4
num_epochs = 2
per_device_train_batch_size = 2
gradient_accumulation_steps = 4
effective_batch_size = 8
warmup_steps = 100
weight_decay = 0.01
max_grad_norm = 1.0
lr_scheduler_type = "cosine"

# Memory optimization
gradient_checkpointing = True
optim = "paged_adamw_8bit"
```

**Hardware**: NVIDIA L40S (48GB VRAM)
**Estimated time**: ~1.5-2 hours
**Estimated cost**: ~$4.50-6.00

## Next Steps

**Option 1: Commit Changes**
User should request a commit if they want to checkpoint these fixes before training.

**Option 2: Begin SFT Training**
All data gates are cleared. Ready to launch Stage 1 SFT training with the configuration above.

## Notes from Codex

### Suggestions (Non-blocking)
- Training pool has repeated prompts (max 13 copies of "What is the difference between weather and climate?")
- This is acceptable for SFT but consider capping repeats for Stage 1.5 or DPO
- Persist truncation audit output alongside data files for future gates

### No Blockers
All critical and high-priority issues resolved. Dataset quality validated at 0.00% issues across all checks.
